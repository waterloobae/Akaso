-- AppleScript to keep a network drive connected

-- Define the network drive details
-- Replace 'username', 'password', 'server_address', and 'share_name' with your network drive's details
set networkDrive to "smb://username:password@server_address/share_name"
set mountPoint to "/Volumes/share_name"

-- Function to check if the network drive is connected
on isDriveConnected()
    try
        -- Attempt to list the contents of the mount point
        do shell script "ls " & quoted form of mountPoint
        return true
    on error
        return false
    end try
end isDriveConnected

-- Function to mount the network drive
on mountDrive()
    try
        -- Create the mount point directory if it doesn't exist
        do shell script "mkdir -p " & quoted form of mountPoint
        -- Mount the network drive
        do shell script "mount -t smbfs " & quoted form of networkDrive & " " & quoted form of mountPoint
    on error errMsg
        -- Display an error dialog if mounting fails
        display dialog "Failed to mount network drive: " & errMsg
    end try
end mountDrive

-- Main loop to keep the network drive connected
repeat
    -- Check if the network drive is connected
    if not isDriveConnected() then
        -- Attempt to mount the network drive if it is not connected
        mountDrive()
    end if
    -- Check every 5 minutes (300 seconds)
    delay 300
end repeat

-- Instructions:
